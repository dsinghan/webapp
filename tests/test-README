In order to run a test checking that the port number is parsed and used
correctly, run the following commands from the powell-cat directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/webserver ../tests/test_config

Then, in a new terminal window in the SAME docker environment, run:

nc localhost 7023

You should be able to send and receive messages from between you and the server.
